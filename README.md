# SparkBar
Display your small data series with this minimal sparkbar component.

## Intro
This project is using Storybook to develop the component.
In Storybook we develop the component for the different use
cases by passing different props and see how it looks.
Together with Storyshots we can test these stories with
Jest snapshots. Very nice!
